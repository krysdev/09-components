1) without IMMER

const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case INCREMENT_COUNT:
      return {
        ...state,
        count: state.count + 1
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};


- STATE can't be directly modified
- a value to use for STATE must be returned (an object)




2) useReducer + IMMER


const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case INCREMENT_COUNT:
      state.count: state.count + 1
      return;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};


- STATE can be mutated
- no value returned for STATE required
- but still need to close each CASE with 'return' (otherwise SWITCH gets to default)
